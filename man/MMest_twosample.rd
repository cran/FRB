\title{ Two Sample MM-Estimates of Location and Covariance  }
\description{
 Computes two-sample MM-estimates of multivariate location and common covariance, 
using initial two-sample S-estimates.
}

\usage{
MMest_twosample(X, groups, control=MMcontrol(...), ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{X}{ matrix or data frame }
  \item{groups}{ vector of 1's and 2's, indicating group numbers }
  \item{control}{a list with control parameters for tuning the MM-estimate and its computing algorithm, 
  see \code{\link{MMcontrol}}().}
  \item{...}{allows for specifying control parameters directly instead of via \code{control}}
}
\details{This function is called by \code{\link{FRBhotellingMM}}
  
  The two-sample MM-estimates are defined by first computing a two-sample S-estimate of location for each sample and common covariance, 
  then fixing its scale component and re-estimating the location vectors and shape by a more efficient M-estimate (see Tatsuoka and Tyler (2000)). 
  Tukey's biweight is used for the loss functions. By default, the first loss function (in the two-sample S-estimate) is tuned 
  in order to obtain 50\% breakdown point. The default tuning of the second loss function (M-estimate) ensures 95\% efficiency at 
  the normal model. This tuning can be changed via argument \code{control} if desired.
  %When interested in location estimates, \code{shapeEff}
 %should be \code{FALSE} (the default), in which case the particular efficiency is that of the location estimates. When interest lies in the covariance or 
  %shape part, it makes sense to set \code{shapeEff=TRUE}, in which case the shape efficiency is considered instead.
      
  The computation of the two-sample S-estimate is performed by a call to \code{\link{Sest_twosample}}, which uses a fast-S-type
  algorithm. Its tuning parameters can be changed via the \code{control} argument.  The M-estimate part is computed
  through iteratively reweighted least squares (RWLS).
  
  Apart from the MM-location estimates \code{Mu1} and \code{Mu2}, the function returns both the common MM-covariance \code{Sigma} and
  common MM-shape estimate \code{Gamma} (which has determinant equal to 1). 
  Additionally, the S-estimates are returned as well (their Gaussian efficiency is usually lower than the MM-estimates but they may 
  have a lower bias).
